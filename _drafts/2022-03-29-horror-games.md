## Introduction

## notes

1. IMMERSION!!
    - that's why you don't hear 2d horror games
    - lighting and sfx mainly
2. LACK OF INFORMATION:
    - about the environment (and so about safe places!)
        - in most games it's ok, in roguelike games crucial is map rng
    - about killer behavior
        - predictable killers give a sense of calm, what we want to achieve is a sense of anxiety
        - that's a good thing about bruto and ghost in monstrum, slime is the example of lack of predictability
        - alien isolation was not scary exactly for that reason (but still a good game if we consider the rest)
        

monstrum killers:
- bruto
    - good sfx when chasing -> terror!
    - proximity information
        - may be misleading (can't tell if it's on the same floor or not)
            -> anxiety from lack of information
- slime
    - least scary killer
    - based on jumpscares mostly -> surprise
    - predictability (vents and slime balls) but no or little proximity information
- ghost
    - proximity information
        - not misleading (you know it's on your floor)
        - but you still don't know where the killer is!
            -> anxiety
    - most dangerous killer!
        - blocks escape
        - can't stay in line of sight for too much

!!! information is the key
