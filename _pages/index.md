Hi, I'm Cah. I like videogames and cybersecurity. Here I will talk about game design (I hate the feeling when you like a videogame and you don't know why) and also I will post writeups of cybersecurity challenges I solve. And in the future who knows, every once in a while I decide to *yolo* on a new topic (*\*cough\** AI coming soon *\*cough\**), so stay tuned.
